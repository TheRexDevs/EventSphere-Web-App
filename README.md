# EventSphere - College Event Information System

## Project Overview

EventSphere is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to revolutionize how college students discover, participate in, and manage campus events. Developed as a final year college project, this platform serves as a centralized hub for event information, registration, and community engagement within our institution.

**Backend API**: [https://eventsphere-backend-i42h.onrender.com](https://eventsphere-backend-i42h.onrender.com)

## Team Members

This project was developed by a team of 6 final year computer science students:

- Team Member 1 (Project Lead)
- Team Member 2 (Frontend Developer)
- Team Member 3 (Backend Developer)
